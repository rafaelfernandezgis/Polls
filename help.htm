        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>

        <h4><u>Polling Station</u></h4>

At the same time, relevant information will be presented in the Polling Station tab at the bottom of the application. In the Polling Station tab, you'll find:<br /><br />1. The name of the polling station, its address, the hours of operations and any specific accomodations.<br />2. Directions to the polling station.<br />3.
